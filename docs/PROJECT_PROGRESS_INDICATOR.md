# DEZZTA CHART — Project Progress Indicator

Status: **operational project-tracking specification**  
Last audited: 2026-11-14  
Repository: https://github.com/deszztagd377-pixel/dezzta-chart  
Official working branch: `phase-2/market-data-foundation`  
Official current stage: **Stage 1 — Foundation, Security & Data Integrity**

> This document defines the **project-process progress indicator**. It is not an in-app technical indicator, chart overlay, or APK feature. Technical indicators such as SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD and Bollinger Bands are separate product work governed by Stage 4.

## 1. Six-stage dashboard

| Stage | Official scope | Current official state | Progress display |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | Foundation, Security & Data Integrity | Active; 30/40 provisional criteria accepted; 10 external criteria open | **75% provisional** |
| 2 | Market Data Infrastructure | Not officially opened; preparatory code exists on the branch | Not scored |
| 3 | Chart Engine & Timeframe | Not officially opened | Not scored |
| 4 | Indicators & Analytics | Not officially opened; calculation groundwork exists | Not scored |
| 5 | Professional UI & Interactive Tools | Not officially opened; expansion gate applies | Not scored |
| 6 | Hardening, Validation & APK Release | Not officially opened | Not scored |

A stage is not opened until all preceding stage acceptance requirements are met and the transition is explicitly recorded. Branch names, code already present, documentation, or CI success cannot silently advance the official stage.

## 2. Stage 1 progress meter

The Stage 1 acceptance matrix contains 40 criteria. For the display meter, each fully accepted criterion earns 10 ticks.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Total criteria | 40 |
| Ticks per criterion | 10 |
| Total available ticks | 400 |
| Provisionally accepted criteria | 30 |
| Earned ticks | 300 |
| Remaining criteria | 10 |
| Remaining ticks | 100 |
| Stage 1 meter | **300 / 400 = 75% provisional** |

Calculation:

`Stage 1 progress = (accepted criteria × 10) ÷ 400 × 100`

One tick represents 0.25 percentage points of Stage 1. A criterion earns all 10 ticks only when its complete acceptance boundary and evidence are satisfied. Otherwise it earns zero. No fractional credit is awarded.

**Important accounting distinction:** 75% is a provisional Stage 1 checklist meter, not production acceptance. Stage 1 is not production-accepted.

## 3. Ten open Stage 1 acceptance criteria

| Criterion | Required evidence / blocker | Safe handling |
|---:|---|---|
| 8 | Owner-controlled no-billing host secret injection and secret absence checks | Repository scans help but cannot prove host configuration |
| 20 | Firebase sign-in, expiry/revocation, entitlement denial and browser/Android flows | Keep production integration disabled unless no-billing configuration is verified |
| 25 | Self-hosted Redis TLS, ACL, private binding, persistence and failure behavior | Requires existing owner-controlled hardware; no paid Redis |
| 30 | Restore a production-like backup into a fresh database and verify application records | CI restore regression is supporting evidence, not the target-environment drill |
| 31 | Encrypted off-host backup, separately stored key, retention/access policy and recovery drill | Keep blocked while compatible authenticated encryption tooling is unresolved |
| 34 | Persistent volume mount, ownership, permissions, restart durability and disk-pressure recovery | Requires target host/device evidence |
| 35 | HTTPS health checks, startup failure and backend-only secrets | Local/LAN is acceptable while public exposure would create cost |
| 36 | Authenticated WSS from supported web and Android clients through reverse proxy | Requires target environment/client evidence |
| 38 | Self-hosted metrics/logs, bounded retention, dashboard and access control | Defer rather than introduce paid observability |
| 39 | No-incremental-cost alert route and documented incident ownership/escalation/recovery | Do not assume email/SMS/push is free |

These are external or target-environment acceptance gates. A repository-only change cannot close them.

## 4. Overall project percentage — separate meter

Historical checkpoints preserved from the owner-approved conversation:

- 20.3% first.
- 20.9% later and most recent owner-confirmed historical checkpoint.
- 19.60% is an older formally recorded estimate, not evidence of regression.
- 19.9% has no reproducible calculation located.

**Fresh overall percentage: not established.**

The proposed M1–M8 weighted ledger totals 100%, but remains unapproved and unscored criterion-by-criterion. Therefore no new overall percentage may be published until:
1. The owner approves or revises the eight milestone weights.
2. Every deliverable is mapped to one primary milestone.
3. Each acceptance criterion is classified using verified evidence.
4. Partial completion is justified and duplicate credit is excluded.
5. The arithmetic is independently checked and recorded against an exact branch HEAD.

Formula after approval:

`Overall progress = Σ (milestone weight × verified completion fraction)`

Do not substitute Stage 1's 75% for overall project progress. Do not award progress merely for commits, file count, code volume, documentation, or unrelated green CI.

## 5. Milestone mapping and anti-double-counting

The proposed ledger groups are:

| ID | Group | Proposed weight | Scoring state |
|---|---|---:|---|
| M1 | Application shell and core chart rendering | 15% | Pending owner approval and audit |
| M2 | Data contracts, validation and persistence foundation | 20% | Pending owner approval and audit |
| M3 | Authentication and application security foundation | 10% | Pending owner approval and audit |
| M4 | Chart interaction and educational drawing/measurement tools | 15% | Pending owner approval and audit |
| M5 | Educational indicator and mathematical visualization layer | 15% | Pending owner approval and audit |
| M6 | Responsive UX, accessibility and visual design | 10% | Pending owner approval and audit |
| M7 | Watchlist, settings and user preference persistence | 5% | Pending owner approval and audit |
| M8 | Quality engineering, reproducible builds and release readiness | 10% | Pending owner approval and audit |
| | **Total** | **100%** | **Not yet an approved scoring model** |

One capability receives one primary milestone credit. Tests validate that capability; they are not a second feature. A calculation helper is not counted as visible indicator UI. A design document is not counted as implemented functionality. DEMO data is never counted as live provider delivery.

## 6. Work-cycle status vocabulary

Every cycle uses these states consistently:

- **Verified complete:** acceptance boundary passed with reproducible evidence.
- **Implemented, not fully verified:** code exists but acceptance evidence is incomplete.
- **In progress:** an active task with a defined next validation.
- **Blocked — internal:** repository-side issue that can be resolved without owner-side access; remediation should be performed in the same work cycle where safe.
- **Blocked — external:** requires owner-controlled host/device, provider, credentials, or owner decision. State the exact dependency and safe alternatives.
- **Deferred by zero-cost/security constraint:** no paid service, trial that may bill, insecure bypass, or weakened security is permitted.
- **Not started / not scored:** future stage or unapproved scope.

A blocker report must state: finding, impact, evidence, remediation attempted/applied, remaining dependency, and the acceptance test that will close it. Do not repeatedly describe the same blocker without taking an available remediation step.

## 7. Per-cycle mandatory report

Each project work cycle must record:

1. Official stage and branch.
2. Exact starting and ending HEAD.
3. Stage meter and formula.
4. Overall historical checkpoint separately from any approved fresh calculation.
5. Acceptance criteria changed and their before/after states.
6. Problems found and concrete fixes applied.
7. Files created/changed and why.
8. Commands or scripts executed by the development environment, if any.
9. Test/build/security results tied to the exact commit.
10. CI run links and final conclusions; queued/running workflows must not be called passed.
11. New commit SHA.
12. Termux/device action only when a specific test requires it, with the reason and verified compatibility. Never hand over a known failing command or ask the owner to repair generated files.

## 8. Termux and zero-cost constraints

- Product direction remains zero incremental cost.
- Do not introduce paid hosting, market-data subscriptions, paid APIs, managed Redis, paid backups/monitoring, paid runners, or trials that can bill.
- Do not switch the owner's Google Play Termux installation to an incompatible repository or bypass APT signature verification.
- The documented Google Play Termux keyring/repository mismatch remains an open external tooling constraint for the encrypted-backup gate. Keep the working source intact; do not import unverified keys, bypass signatures, or weaken the cryptography requirement.
- No Termux command is required for this project-process indicator documentation.
- Google Play publication remains deferred; the target is an installable APK on the owner's device when Stage 6 acceptance is reached.

## 9. Stage gates and expansion rules

- Stage 1 must be accepted before official transition to Stage 2.
- Each subsequent stage must satisfy its own documented acceptance gate before moving forward.
- The 40% overall-project gate is for major UI/feature expansion planning. It requires a reconciled approved ledger, scoped blueprint, and owner review. It does not bypass stage order.
- Visible technical indicator controls and overlays belong to Stage 4, not the project-process progress meter.
- Footprint, Heatmap and Liquidation Maps remain gated by owner-provided visual references, a scoped blueprint and owner review. Footprint remains explicitly SIMULATED unless a separately validated real-data source is implemented.

## 10. Current evidence snapshot — 2026-11-14

- Repository: `deszztagd377-pixel/dezzta-chart`
- Working branch: `phase-2/market-data-foundation`
- Source HEAD audited before the project-meter documentation commit: `10046851065e41fa73bdcf757eb87b02e5a12b6d`
- Automated Tests: [run #43567126816](https://github.com/deszztagd377-pixel/dezzta-chart/actions/runs/43567126816) — success on that exact source HEAD.
- CodeQL: [run #43567126843](https://github.com/deszztagd377-pixel/dezzta-chart/actions/runs/43567126843) — success on that exact source HEAD.

- The project-meter documentation commit is separate from the tested source commit. Its own Automated Tests workflow was still running at the time of this snapshot; do not treat it as passed until its exact-HEAD run concludes successfully.
- CI success does not close external criteria 8, 20, 25, 30, 31, 34, 35, 36, 38 or 39.
- Stage 1 remains 300/400 ticks = 75% provisional and not production-accepted.
- No fresh overall percentage is calculated.
